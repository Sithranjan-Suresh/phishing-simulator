# Phishing Attack Simulator

A full-stack cybersecurity training web application that simulates real-world phishing attacks in a completely safe, ethical, and local environment.

This project helps users understand the full phishing attack chain ‚Äî from receiving a spoofed email to entering credentials on a fake login page ‚Äî while logging user actions and visualizing behavior for educational purposes.

## Features

### Frontend
- **Landing Page**: Professional home page with a clear mission, disclaimers, and GitHub link.
- **Simulated Phishing Email Page**: Realistic email from ‚ÄúSecureBanking‚Äù urging users to click a verification link.
- **Fake Login Page**: Mimics a real banking login page; captures any credentials entered.
- **Credential Capture Page**: Logs fake credentials and explains the purpose of the simulation.

### Backend Functionality
- **Click Tracking**: Records user clicks on phishing links, including timestamps and target info.
- **Credential Logging**: Stores submitted fake credentials in a local SQLite database.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Visualizes phishing success rates with a data table and click behavior chart (Chart.js).

## Real-World Case Study

### Objective
To test the effectiveness of the phishing simulator, I conducted a live phishing simulation with 4 participants. The goal was to observe user responses to a realistic phishing email and evaluate the educational value of the tool.

### Method
Participants received a spoofed email from "SecureBanking" asking them to verify their account. The simulator tracked:
- Email link clicks
- Credential submissions
- Timestamps for all interactions

Participants were then shown a warning page and debriefed about the simulation.

### Results

| Participant | Clicked Link | Entered Credentials | Reaction Time |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Ojas        | ‚ùå No         | ‚ùå No                | ‚Äî              |
| Manan       | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚ùå No                | 2 minutes      |
| Anuj        | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚ùå No                | 1 minute       |
| Ayush       | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚úÖ Yes              | 5 minutes      |

- **75%** of participants clicked the link.
- **25%** submitted fake credentials.
- Only **1** user identified the phishing attempt and avoided it entirely.

### Participant Feedback
- ‚ÄúIt looked really real ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt even question the link.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThe layout made me trust it. But I got suspicious when the login form didn‚Äôt redirect properly.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThe warning page after submitting credentials really drove it home.‚Äù

### Takeaways
- Most users are susceptible to clicking phishing links ‚Äî even when they‚Äôre tech-savvy.
- Educational feedback directly after the attempt was key to reinforcing learning.
